      <h2>Feedback Submission #1</h2>
      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1/5 ⭐</p>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Safe browsing is killing my productivity</p>
      <p>The new safe browsing feature is absolutely terrible. I get interrupted every 30 seconds with confirmation dialogs asking if I "really want to visit this site." I'm trying to do research for work and I have to click through dozens of these warnings just to browse normal websites. There needs to be a way to disable this or at least reduce the sensitivity. It's treating every site like it's malicious.</p>

      <h2>Feedback Submission #2</h2>
      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/5 ⭐⭐</p>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Too many prompts - can't get work done</p>
      <p>This safe browsing thing is driving me crazy. I understand security is important but I shouldn't need to confirm every single link I click. I'm a developer and I need to access multiple repositories, documentation sites, and testing environments throughout the day. The constant "Are you sure you want to continue?" prompts are breaking my workflow completely. Please add a "trusted user" mode or something.</p>

      <h2>Feedback Submission #3</h2>
      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1/5 ⭐</p>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Worst feature update ever</p>
      <p>Safe browsing has made our company laptops practically unusable. Every employee is complaining about the non-stop confirmation dialogs. We can't efficiently browse internal company sites, partner portals, or even basic research without clicking through multiple warnings. This feature needs better allowlisting options or the ability to be disabled for enterprise users. Our IT team is getting constant complaints.</p>

      <h2>Feedback Submission #4</h2>
      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1/5 ⭐</p>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Confirmation overload</p>
      <p>I spend half my day clicking "Yes, I'm sure" buttons instead of actually working. The safe browsing feature doesn't seem to learn from my browsing patterns or remember sites I've already approved. Even legitimate business sites like LinkedIn, GitHub, and our CRM system trigger these annoying confirmations. There has to be a middle ground between security and usability.</p>

      <h2>Feedback Submission #5</h2>
      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/5 ⭐⭐</p>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Good idea, terrible execution</p>
      <p>Safe browsing could be useful but it's implemented terribly. The confirmation threshold is way too low - it flags everything as potentially dangerous. I get warnings for news sites, shopping sites, and even Microsoft's own documentation pages. The "Always allow this site" option doesn't seem to work consistently either. Need better machine learning to reduce false positives.</p>

      <h2>Feedback Submission #6</h2>
      <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1/5 ⭐</p>
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Breaks normal web browsing</p>
      <p>This feature has completely broken normal web browsing. I can't click on search results without getting a warning. Email links don't work smoothly anymore. Even clicking between pages on the same website sometimes triggers confirmations. It's like the system assumes every click is dangerous. Please give us granular controls or just remove this feature entirely.</p>
